						<h2>Welcome to OnVision</h2>
						<p> A Solution to automate the manual surveillance systems in Sri Lanka
							using Machine Learning.</p>

						<p> A prominent digital approach is the usage of CCTV to gather video and audio data about the
							environments with high security concerns through remote observation instead of physical
							observation. In a country like Sri Lanka security status constantly requires maintaining
							public order and provide community safety.</p>

						<p> Our area of focus is to automatically detect Fires, Road Accidents, White Line Violation on
							Roads and Public Unrest using the CCTV surveillance.</p>

						<p> Main Services provide by our system are automatic detection of the incidents and issuing
							detailed alerts real-time which will benefit the security officials in the country to take
							necessary and immediate actions.</p>

				<h3>Literature Survey</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-6">
						<p>Fires, Traffic rule violations, Accidents, and Civil unrest are the most prominent areas in
							Sri
							Lanka where people tend to break rules and disasters happen due to misfocus. Identification
							of
							Fires, Traffic Rule violations mainly based on White lines, Traffic Accident detection and
							Civil
							unrest situations involving fights need to be implemented to match the objectives of the
							proposed system. Many expert systems have been invented to identify and react productively
							against the selected security concerns. Most of the internationally conducted research just
							focus on one security area unlikely the conducted research which focus on multiple different
							security scenarios. Research conducted to identify fires from CCTVs has focused on
							identifying
							the fire activations using the initial states of fire [1], the lengths and the spread area
							of
							fires [2] and color and the shape of fire crystals [3] using R-CNN algorithmic approaches.
							For
							Traffic rule violation most of the conducted research centered around Tracking individual
							vehicles [4], get detailed traffic information for individual vehicles [4], use automatic
							detection line calculation algorithm to detect detailed vehicle movements [4], apply traffic
							conflict evaluation techniques for the tracking VIPS [5] and usage of (RFID) technology
							which
							uses radio waves for identifying objects and speed [6]. The researchers have identified
							various
							systems to improve successful accident detection systems. Mainly western countries have
							researched about various scenarios in accident detection. Most of the conducted research and
							developed systems well defined around accident that take place in highways and traffic
							situations [7], usage of object tracking methods to track each vehicle [7], detecting the
							shape
							of vehicles, addressing the lighting issues that can affect to accident identification
							process
							[8] and detecting the angle of the vehicle and speed change before declaring it as an
							accident
							[9]. Highly utilized technologies for stated processes are R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional
							Neural Network), YOLO v3 algorithm, and DETR (Detection Transformer), Canny edge detection
							algorithms. Mostly the unrest detection is considered as a form of human action and form of
							violence in already conducted research. Most violent detection research has taken
							Classifying
							situations as violent or non-violent [10], focus on the crowds and non-crowd-based scenarios
							[11], Analysis of long video clips [12] using deep learning concepts like 3D CNN, 2D CNN,
							and
							LSTM (long short-term memory), convLSTM (convolutional long-short memory). </p>

				<h3>Research Gap</h3>

					<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-6">
						<p>From 2010 onwards Sri Lanka Police declared open a CCTV unit considering the past historical
							events like terrorism which highly affected the country’s security. According to Sri Lanka
							police web resources, CCTV surveillance is used to establish the country’s security in many
							aspects. There is no record of using CCTV footage for Fires, Road Accidents, Traffic rule
							violations, and Civil Unrest detection in real-time or automatically considered in Sri
							Lanka.
							The current prevailing system of Sri Lanka completely dwells on manual supervision done by
							an
							administrative panel. The most common approach is using CCTV clips of unrest behavior for
							post-investigation purposes. Also, most of the internationally proposed methodologies has
							not
							deployed as a system and many of them depend on technologies like CNN s which are proven not
							very ideal for a real-time environment.<br />
							Summary,<br />
							• Lack of an automated system in Sri Lanka.<br />
							• Lack Real-time identification and alert generation in Sri Lanka.<br />
							• Absence of an effective notification generation.<br />
							• Utilization of technologies that supports the real-time environment.<br />
							• Covering several security aspects through one system.</p>

							The research conducted to implement a CCTV Based Enhanced Public Security Management System
							for
							Sri Lanka using machine learning and image processing. Implementation followed the
							addressing of
							areas of concern regarding to security in Sri Lanka highlighted in the identified research
							problems. As the solution an approach using YOLO V5 algorithms for Detection of Fires, Road
							Accidents, Civil Unrest situation and White line violation on roads is developed. Problem of
							issuing alerts for respective officials also exist during a detection of selected security
							factors. Administrators of the existing system has heavy workload due to manual supervision
							of
							CCTV feeds and lack of proper notification generation. As the further approach to the
							solution
							an efficient alert system is also integrated to the developed solution using the SMS

					<main class="">
						<p> <b>Automatic Detection of Fires</b> <br />
							During an incident of fire disaster, the automatic system needs to respond in real time by
							identifying the situation. The response is to be send an alert to fire brigade, hospitals,
							and police CCTV division. The system's primary target is to accurately recognize and
							differentiate real-time fire incidents in Sri Lanka using additional information based on
							the environmental condition and wind direction and calculate the risk of fire spreading it
							as a percentage.
						</p>
						<p> <b>Automatic Detection of Accidents in Roads</b><br />
							One of the objectives of implementing the proposed system is automate the current manual
							process of accident identification in Sri Lanka. The automated process can respond in
							real-time when accident happen. The response is to be send an alert to hospitals and police
							CCTV division, by considering the several facts like weather condition, road condition and
							correctly identifying the location. The results are presented a percentage of detection and
							severity levels.</p>
						<p> <b>Automatic Detection of White Line Violation on Roads</b><br />
							One of the main purposes of the system is to identify White line violation around
							intersection points on the road using an automated rule violation system. The response is to
							be send an alert to Traffic police division and police CCTV division to take necessary
							action regarding the violators on time using their location of violation.  The solution has
							the mechanism of monitoring the intersections and violations will be tracked by an algorithm
							and the number plate of the vehicle will be captured which helps the traffic police
							department to issue fines for the violators. </p>
						<p> <b>Automatic Detection of Public Unrest Behavior</b><br />
							The final objective of the system is to identify the unrest situations related to the street
							fighting on the roads or public places. Identification proceeds with detecting and
							localizing regions related to the unrest behavior from the incoming video frames from the
							CCTV stream and issuing a confident score for the detection. Presence of the human figures
							and fighting is analyzed and alerts get issued in to the Criminal Investigations department
							and CCTV division of the Sri Lanka police using the severity levels and the detected
							location.</p>

				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-6">
						<p>The purposed CCTV based surveillance system is contain four main components according to the
							detections.<br />
							1. Fire detection and analysis<br />
							2. Traffic rule violation detection<br />
							3. Accident detection and analysis<br />
							4. Human Image and Unrest Detection detection<br />
							The system diagram of Fig 2 has shown the high-level approach that the system has developed
							with
							the several technologies and techniques. The CCTV camara feed take into the system and
							convert
							to set of frames which are the input for Flask server system. The frames have redirected to
							the
							four components and the YOLO V5 object detection model will identify the main objects
							relevant
							to the incidents from subsequent frames and extract those frames. As shown in the diagram
							the
							extracted frames have further analyzed to get details of the incident. The location of the
							incident is one of the details that get from IP address of the CCTV camera. The current
							weather
							condition in incident location takes from Open Weather API. Alerts will generate including
							the
							identified details and send to the registered users using Text It SMS API.
							The main users of the system which is Sri Lanka Police CCTV Division use the administration
							application and the incident notification and details will preview in the application. The
							other
							users like hospitals and fire bridged can register to the system from admin application. For
							those users could be able to get SMS notification in the real-time if incident detected.
							After incident detection the subsequent frames that include the incident will save in the
							Mongo
							database. Also, the record details will store as a log in separate cluster for retrieving
							purposes. </p>
